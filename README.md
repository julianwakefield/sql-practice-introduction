# SQL Practice

SQL provides a way for us to access
and store data from a database. While we
teach it in conjunction with Ruby, it is
an entirely separate language that can take
time to become comfortable using and reading.

In this section are additional SQL challenges
to help you hone your querying skills. Topics
covered in these challenges include:

* Querying specific data
* Aggregating data values
* Grouping and sorting data
* Using SQL joins
